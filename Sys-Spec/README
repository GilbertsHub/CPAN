Module::Build INSTALLS
--------------------------------------------------------------

If the Module::Build module is available, the following is likely 
the preferred way of installing Sys::Spec and friends:

    perl Build.PL
    perl ./Build 
    perl ./Build test     #(will fail on older perls without Test::More)
    perl ./Build install

To test if your local perl supports Build.PL, execute the following
command. If it completes without error then Build.PL is available.

    perl -MModule::Build -e 1

To test if Test::More is available, execute the following command:

    perl -MTest::More -e 1


--------------------------------------------------------------
Legacy (e.g., UNIX/POSIX/LINUX) Installs
--------------------------------------------------------------

The following legacy installation is available to those without
Module::Build but with commands that are sufficiently POSIX compatible.

    perl Makefile.PL  [PREFIX=$HOME/alt-perl]
    make 
    make test 		# (will fail on older perls without Test::More)
    make install

#end
