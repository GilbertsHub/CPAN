OVERVIEW
---------------------------

Provides a small number of high-quality random numbers to calling
applications using a small, pure-perl, class.

Goes beyond the traditional limits of perls rand() built-in by
accessing the random-number API found in most modern kernals. 
In typical environments these kernal APIs provide high-quality, 
cryptographically secure, random numbers to knowledgable applications.
The Random::BestTiny class bridges the vast differences in accessing 
these APIs across different kernel implementations. If desired,
local developers can add their own random number subclasses to the class.

If the the large Math::Random::Secure class is present, Random::BestTiny
assumes perl's built-in rand() method was overridden by Math::Random::Secure
to produce large numbers of high-quality random numbers and will use
that rand() method to get random numbers.


INSTALLING
---------------------------
This module can be installed like any other CPAN module

To manually install, expand the the arcive, then within the
archive directory,

        perl Build.PL
        perl Build
        perl Build test
        perl Build fakeinstall	#optional preinstall dry-run
        perl Build install

         # Note: Unix tests may block for periods of time due to high
           consumption of random numbers.

To install in an alternate directory, such as a temporary directory to 
review the file, change the first command to have the target directory:

        perl Build.PL --destdir $the_directory


REBUILDING
---------------------------
        perl Build realclean;	#optional: clear all prior temporary files
        perl Build.PL;		#optional: generate fresh Build script
	perl Build dist		#build new
	perl Build distcheck	#check distribution
