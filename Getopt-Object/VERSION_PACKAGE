#       $VERSION is value that Makefile.PL finds, so it must have 
#                the proper number.
#       $VERSION_PACKAGE is global we copy the package version 
#                into for use by callers using 'require'. Such 
#                callers redefine $VERSION to their version, rather
#                than keeping the package version. See Build.PL.
