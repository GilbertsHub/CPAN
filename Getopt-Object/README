Getopt::Object and Getopt::ObjectSimple are copyright (C) 2011-2012, 2016 by Gilbert Healton

OVERVIEW
---------------------------

Getopt::Object and Getopt::ObjectSimple provide command line parsing 
in true object format with additional features to Getopt::Long this
author finds useful. Getopt::ObjectSimple provides a minimalist 
approach with Getopt::Object providing the most features.

Additional features beyond Getopt::Long are also made available,
including:

  * The ability to set mandatory options. Constructor calls fail if
    such options are not well defined.
  * Provides a singleton constructor for use in capturing command 
    line options.
  * When main programs call the singleton to capture options,
      * Any module may call the singleton after successful 
        option parsing to access the all command line options.
      * (Getopt::Object only) Any module compiled before the singleton 
        is called may, with restrictions, add options for itself to
        the list of options the singleton will honor. This requires 
        no special coordination between the module and the main 
        beyond using the singleton constructor. 

INSTALLING
---------------------------
This module is installed like any CPAN module

To manually install, expand the the archive, then within the
archive directory,

        perl Build.PL
        perl Build
        perl Build test
        perl Build install

To install in an alternate directory, such as a temporary directory to 
review the file, change the first command to have the target directory:

        perl Build.PL --destdir $the_directory


A Makefile.PL install file is also present for the nostalgic.

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install


REBUILDING
---------------------------
        perl Build realclean;	#optional: clear all prior temporary files
        perl Build.PL;		#optional: generate fresh Build script
	perl Build dist		#build new
	perl Build distcheck	#check distribution
