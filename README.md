The GilbertsHub "organization" holds assorted files Gilbert Healton has
made available under various open source licenses for a number of
years. Basically the repository was created to consolidate all 
of the code in a single place.



# CPAN
Perl packages in the style of CPAN, perhaps on CPAN
The goal is to get these on CPAN sometime. 

Status: reasonably complete for typical use


# CL-Tools
Command line tools for use in UNIX style shell commands.

Status: often old code, but it works for me.


# web-utils
Tools for use in web development. 

Status: often old code, but it still works when I needed it.
